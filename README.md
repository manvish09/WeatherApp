# WeatherApp
This is an attempt to build a simple application that shows the current temperature of a city.
I have used the Open Weather API for this project and the only thing this project does is to display the temperature of a city.
I have learned working on APIs, node modules like express,https and body-parser. Also got to know how the get, post and listen methods work.
